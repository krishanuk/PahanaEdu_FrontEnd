PahanaEdu Frontend contains the user interface of the Bookshop Management System, developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TailwindCSS. This part of the project allows cashiers and admins to interact with the system, manage products, handle orders, and view customer details. The frontend communicates with the backend REST API to fetch and update data in real-time, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.
